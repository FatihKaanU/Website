    <h1>Third Day</h1>
    <h2>Java</h2>
    Java is one of the most popular coding languages among with C and Phyton. It is used in most softwares.
    <p>As i said with HTML coding is hard and you first need o learn the language. But it still makes sense and relatively simple.</p>
    Here is a code to show off;
    
    <p>myStr = "Dart"</p> 
    <p>myStr[0] = "F"</p>

    Of course it doesn't work here but it would be funny if it did.
